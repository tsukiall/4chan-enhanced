# 4chan Enhanced
QOL improvements and additional functionality over the 4chan experience
## What does it do?
### Settings sync
All of the settings the site stores in the local storage and cookies are also stored in the chrome sync storage.
### Catalog Changes
- The post menu dropdown has been converted to buttons for quicker access - flag for reporting, pin for pinning and unpinning, and eye for hiding and unhiding.
- The post subject is moved to a new line for better clarity between the subject and the OP comment.
- The post metadata is colored red when a limit on replies or images has been reached.
- Watched threads are outlined similar to pinned ones.
- Added image hover tied to the original 4chan setting.
### Thread Watcher Changes
- Added board dividers.
- Updated unwatch buttons.
- Added status icons.
### Thread Changes
- Added gallery view activated from any post with media item via the video camera button. The gallery makes use of the arrow keys to navigate and escape to close.
