# 4chan Enhanced
QOL improvements and additional functionality over the 4chan experience
## What does it do?
### Settings sync
All of the local storage settings are synced in the extension storage. This means watched threads, site settings, custom css and everything else is shared between all devices.
### Catalog Changes
- The post menu dropdown has been converted to buttons for quicker access - flag for reporting, pin for pinning and unpinning, and eye for hiding and unhiding.
- The post subject is moved to a new line for better clarity between the subject and the OP comment.
- The post metadata is colored red when a limit on replies or images has been reached.
- Watched threads are outlined similar to pinned ones.
- Added image hover tied to the original 4chan setting.
### Thread Watcher Changes
- Added board dividers.
- Updated unwatch buttons.
- Added status icons. Red for deleted, blue for archived, pink for replies, purple for new posts, and green for no activity.
- Any thread will record its progress, continuing where you left off.
- Thread watcher new replies number is changed to unseen number of posts.
### Thread Changes
- Added gallery view activated from any post with media item via the video camera button. The gallery makes use of the arrow keys to navigate and escape to close.
